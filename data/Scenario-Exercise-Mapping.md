# Problem +Knowledge-Segment + Exercise

- Problem: User has a crisis in a personal relationships with their partner, friends, family, or at work
    - Knowledge Segment:
        - When facing personal relationship crises (with parents, spouses, friends, coworkers, etc.), negative feelings such as humiliation, pain, and indignity, along with hatred and revenge, overwhelm the child, who becomes dominant with respect to the adult.\n\n In these circumstances, the adult is so influenced by the negative feelings of the child that they are unable to find a solution to the crisis. \n\n In such a crisis, we start by consistently **practising the protocols for moderating current negative affects** and **inducing laughter** to contain the childhood’s negative affects.\n\nAs a result, we **avoid behaving and saying things in a reactive manner that can worsen the crisis**.\n\nBy practising the protocols for containing negative affects **we learn patience and self-control.**
        - ADVANCED: After practicing the protocols for decreasing negative affects and increasing positive affects, it is easier for the child to be aware of the following:  That when faced with a crisis in a personal/social relationship, we tend to project our internal persecutor on to the other person and like a victimized child, we blame them as the aggressor. With a sense of narcissism and righteousness we try to control this person and others. All this wastes a great deal of our energy and destroys our creativity. When the child is aware of this, it can gradually come to the following very important realization: That **they need not consider themselves a prisoner of their early family environment and its consequent emotions.** Guided by the adult, the child learns that narcissism and projecting the internal persecutor onto others blocks their creativity and does not serve them.\n\nThe child feels that, through secure attachment to the adult, they can develop a more optimal internal working model to interpret and maintain relations with others to enjoy a sense of inner calm with themselves and with others.
    - Advice:
    - Exercise:
        - **[Exercise 9] "Overcoming current negative emotions”:** With closed eyes, imagine the unhappy photo and project your negative emotions to the unhappy photo representing the Child. While doing this:(i) loudly reassure the Child, and (ii) give your face/neck/head a self-massage. Repeat these steps until you are calmed and comforted.
        - **[Exercise 10] "Overcoming past pain.”:** With closed eyes, recall a painful childhood episode, such as emotional or physical abuse or loss of a significant figure, with all the details your still remember. Associate the face of the Child you were in the past with the selected unhappy photo. As you remember the associated emotions (e.g., helplessness, humiliation and rage), with closed eyes, imagine your Adult intervening in the scene like a good parent. Imagine your Adult, (i) approaching your Child quickly like any good parent with their child in distress, (ii) loudly reassuring the Child that you have now come to save them, by standing up with a loud voice to any perpetrator, for example: “Why are you hitting my Child?”, and, by supporting the Child with a loud voice, for example: “My darling, I will not let them hurt you anymore”, (iii) imaginatively cuddling your Child, by a face/neck/head self-massage. Repeat (i), (ii), (iii) until comforted and soothed, acquiring mastery over the trauma.
        - **[Exercise 11] "Muscle relaxation and playful face for intentional laughing (ET)”:** Just as negative patterns can cause rigidity in our mind and behaviour, they can also lead to rigidity in facial and body muscles, which can limit the emotional development of our child and the ability to laugh. That's why your Adult self should ask your Child Self to act funny like a child: loosen up facial and body muscles, open up your mouth and sing your favourite song while laughing (or at least smiling) on your own.
        - **[Exercise 13] "Laughing with our childhood self (ST, IT and ET)”**: Looking at your happy photo, invite your child to smile and then begin to laugh for at least 10 seconds. Repeat this process at least three times.
        - **[Exercise 14] "Intentional laughter (ET, IT and ST)”**: At a time when you are alone, open your mouth slightly, loosen your face muscles, raise your eyebrows, then invite your child to slowly and continuously repeat one of the following tones, each of which uses a minimum amount of energy: eh, eh, eh, eh; or ah, ah, ah, ah; or oh, oh, oh, oh; or uh, uh, uh, uh; or ye, ye, ye, ye. If you need a subject to laugh at, you can laugh at the silliness of the exercise! Once this continuous intentional laughter becomes a habit, your child would be able to shape it according to your personality and style to create your own brand of laughter.
        - **[Exercise 17] "Identifying patterns of acting out personal resentments”**: Try to identify any pattern of narcissistic and anti-social feelings that your Child has acted out in your current or past relationships or any long-term resentment borne against someone. Try to recognize how much of your time and energy is consumed in such acting out and bearing resentment. Try to think and feel in opposite ways to these negative feelings.
        - **[Exercise 18] "Planning more constructive actions”**: Work out a new way to handle, in future, what you have identified as acting out anti-social feelings or bearing personal resentment in your life. 1. Without denying these feelings, try to reflect and contain them and avoid acting them out. Try to nurture opposite thoughts and feelings. Try to let go of the personal resentment. This may be hard and challenging but it is necessary for emotional growth. Here, you are taking a critical but constructive stance towards your Child and are exercising foresighted compassion. 2. Find a positive way of re-channeling the aggressive energy invoked by these feelings to productive work (e.g., going for some exercise, talking to a friend, etc.) and ultimately to creative work towards your noble goal in life.
        - ADVANCED: **Exercise 25, “Solving personal crisis”**: After the child’s emotional level is reduced and as we continue to practice the protocol for modulating negative affects, and the protocol for laughter, we ask our child the following:\n\nHow can you see the crisis as a way of becoming stronger? \n\nHow can you interpret the crisis as a way of reaching your high goal? \n\nHas the internal persecutor been projecting onto others again?\n\nThe adult asks the following questions:\n\nWhat is the similarity between this crisis and the ones I have faced before? How is it similar to the family crisis I experienced as a child? Aren’t the other person’s positive attributes greater than his/her negative ones? How would a mature person interpret the crisis in comparison to my child? Can I see it from the perspective of someone else? Can I put myself in their place and understand their affects? Given my new inner working model can I find a way to calm the people involved in the crisis so we can find a better solution for it?\n\nIf not, can I respectfully maintain my distance and end the argument?

        - ADVANCED: **Exercise 24, “Recognizing and containing the internal persecutor”:** Thinking from the perspective of the adult, the user (adult) should should review the experience with awareness of how their internal persecutor operates. Adult should carefully analyze their life experiences for examples of projecting the internal persecutor onto others. Based on the above, the Adult re-evaluates their experiences, contains the internal persecutor with its victim mentality and blame games, allowing the development of creativity.
- Problem: User doesn’t feel comfortable speaking out loud to their inner child
    - Knowledge Segment:
        - The purpose of speaking out loud to the child is to create an emotional bond with them and help them reach higher levels of maturity in their emotional development. Even though we cannot see our child, the area of our brain that relates to long-term memories can hear our voice and recognize its kind content. This helps strengthen the emotional bond with the child and help them in their emotional development to higher levels of maturity.  In childhood, speaking to one’s self in a loud voice used to play an important role in emotional and cognitive development and the establishment of an internal dialogue.\n\nDuring school years, discipline often leads to the elimination of talking out loud with one’s self.\n\nOften, this is also suppressed at home.\n\nResearch shows that adults who speak out loud with themselves when solving cognitive problems are often more successful.\n\nThus, speaking to one’s self out loud, whether as a child or an adult, is a sign of emotional and cognitive maturity and not a sign of madness.
    - Advice: Give yourself time and patience, but try again. Try singing first since it will release dopamine and make you more open to exercises.
    - Exercise:
        - **[Exercise 3] "Singing a song of affection”**: Print copies of a happy photo to display at home, work, and in your wallet. You can also set it as the background on your phone and laptop. Then, select a jolly lyrical song you cherish that invokes feelings of warmth, affection, and love. Learn the song by heart and sing it as often as you can in your daily routine. While looking at the happy photo, sing the song, as a way to establish a deep emotional bond with the child in your mind. Start quietly; then, over time, allow your voice to become louder while using more of your body (e.g. shaking your shoulders, hands, and lifting your eyebrows up and down). Imagine that in this way, like a parent, you are joyfully dancing and playing with the child.
        - **[Exercise 4] “Expressing love and care for the child”**: While genuinely smiling at the happy photo, loudly say to your child: \n ****”I passionately love you and deeply care for you”. Repeat this for five to ten minutes.
        - **[Exercise 5] “Vowing to care for the child”:** In this exercise, we start to care for the child as our own child. We attribute and project our own emotions to the child. We, as our adult self, begin with a pledge we make at a special time and place. After reading the pledge silently, we confidently pledge out loud the following: \n “From now on, I will seek to act as a devoted and loving parent to this child, consistently and wholeheartedly care for them in every way possible. I will do everything I can to support the health and emotional growth of this child.” Repeat this for ten minutes.
        - **[Exercise 7.1] “Maintaining a loving relationship with the child”**: Choose some short phrase, e.g., “You are my beautiful child” or “My love”. Say it slowly, out loud at least 5 times as you look at the happy photo. Then sing your favorite chosen love song at least 5 times. As previously, increase your volume and begin to use your whole body.
        - **[Exercise 7.2] “Creating a zest for life”**: While looking in a mirror, imagine your image to be that of the child, then begin to loudly sing your previously chosen song. As previously, increase your volume and begin to use your whole body. Do this twice now and then as many times as possible in different circumstances during the day, such as while on the way to work or while cooking dinner, to integrate them into your new life. When singing your favorite song becomes a habit of yours, it becomes an effective tool for enhancing positive affects and managing emotions.

- Problem: User feels that laughing at a situation is disrespectful, wrong, or not appropriate
    - Knowledge Segment:
        - Laughing at things that we have taken seriously is being playful, and not a sign of disrespect or contempt for anyone including ourselves. Our laughter takes place with compassion and love for the child. This is rooted in the belief that, after initially gaining the skills to enhance positive emotions, we are better adept at revisiting and reprocessing childhood traumas later on. The goal is to come to believe that, unlike in the past, in this game, we can experiment with seeing our problems and issues in a positive light and with a sense of humour and joy. Continuous laughter can be the best antidote to stress, and laughing exercises are like an antidote for depression, because it creates a layer of depersonalization that allows our nervous system to regulate itself, before we try approaching our problem again. After repeated practice of the laughing exercises, we can begin to apply it to things that worry us in the present and the future.
        - Keep Incongruity theory and the Gestalt Vase in mind: Based on our beliefs, we often have certain expectations in life, including from our partner, family, friends, colleagues, professionals, businesses etc. When these expectations are violated, we feel upset, resentful and angry. The more we expect from others and life, the more upset we would become. The best strategy to cope with violation of our expectation is to use incongruity theory to laugh as soon as we can at the incongruity between what we expected and what happened. Such laughter is highly creative as it reduces negative emotions.
        - A major context for humour is any incongruity in our own life, mind, emotions and behaviour , including our own contradictions, conflicts, change of mood, attitudes , thoughts, assumptions, expectations. By learning to be playful about our feelings/thoughts, our child has the
        chance to be flexible about our emotions, views and behaviour. By laughing gently, without self disparaging, at our own incongruities, we self regulate our emotions, attaining a wiser mindset.
        - Remember: Laughing at an unpleasant upset is against your expectation, learned norms and values, but you can think of this itself as a harmless incongruity that helps you laugh. Note that you’ve survived your upsets and setbacks; they may have even been useful for you. Perhaps they placed you on a creative path, or taught you lessons that made you wiser. Yet, you continue to perceive them as “painful”, considering yourself a victim of these events. This harmless incongruity can be a motivator for you to laugh.
        - We learn from our family and cultural experiences when to laugh and when to refrain from laughter. Securely attached children laugh a great deal every day during play. While a negative emotion is a natural reaction to an upset, one can always learn to see it in a different light and eventually laugh. Our adult can invite our child to laugh as a way of being playful, and over time our child can come to see problems and challenges eventually in a positive light and with a sense of humour and joy. Our child can learn to laugh as an intentional mental exercise, without a funny stimulus being present.
        - Genuine (belly) laughter is non hostile. If in our child’s laughter we sense any contempt against ourselves or others, our adult needs to encourage the child to try to neutralise the contempt. And convert it into surprise, incongruity or simple amusement and thus to non
        hostile laughter.
    - Advice:
    - Exercise:
        - **[Exercise 13] "Laughing with our childhood self (ST, IT and ET)”**: Looking at your happy photo, invite your child to smile and then begin to laugh for at least 10 seconds. Repeat this process at least three times.
        - **[Exercise 14] "Intentional laughter (ET, IT and ST)”**: At a time when you are alone, open your mouth slightly, loosen your face muscles, raise your eyebrows, then invite your child to slowly and continuously repeat one of the following tones, each of which uses a minimum amount of energy: eh, eh, eh, eh; or ah, ah, ah, ah; or oh, oh, oh, oh; or uh, uh, uh, uh; or ye, ye, ye, ye. If you need a subject to laugh at, you can laugh at the silliness of the exercise! Once this continuous intentional laughter becomes a habit, your child would be able to shape it according to your personality and style to create your own brand of laughter.
        - **[Exercise 15.1] "Learning to change your perspective”**: Stare at the black vase and laugh for one minute the moment your perception changes and you see two white faces, conceived as Adult and Child, looking at each other. Stare at the two white faces and laugh for one minute the moment your perception change and you see the black vase.
        - **[Exercise 15.2] "Incongruous world.”:** Detect incongruities and thus humour in the current system between what it promises via the managers and leaders and what it actually does in accentuating rather than solving our problems in particular our existential crisis.
        - **[Exercise 15.3] "Self-world incongruity”:** Revisit or manage, respectively, a recent or current upsetting event against your expectation of life or others, considering it as an opportunity to laugh by IT.
        - **[Exercise 15.4] "Incongruous self.”**: Practice being cognizant of any incongruity or discrepancy in your emotional or mental world in the past or present and use them, by IT, as a reason to laugh without self-depreciation.
        - **[Exercise 16] : "Learning to be playful about your past pains”:**  Visualize a painful event that took place in the past that you have struggled with, and despite its painfulness, try to see a positive impact it has had for you. Use any of the theories for humour and invite your child to be playful about it and try to laugh at the event.
        - **[Exercise 11] "Muscle relaxation and playful face for intentional laughing (ET)”:** Just as negative patterns can cause rigidity in our mind and behaviour, they can also lead to rigidity in facial and body muscles, which can limit the emotional development of our child and the ability to laugh. That's why your Adult self should ask your Child Self to act funny like a child: loosen up facial and body muscles, open up your mouth and sing your favourite song while laughing (or at least smiling) on your own.

- Problem: User doesn’t understand the purpose of imagining their inner child during protocols
    - Knowledge Segment:
        - Problems managing our emotions are usually rooted in our childhood. This means we may have not developed the skills to moderate our excitements, regulate our emotions, or to laugh at times of stress. In SAT, the adult learns how a good parent interacts with a child, and through **role playing** they become a parent for their child. The intervention strategy is based on collaboration between the adult and the child for regulating emotions and learning to laugh even under stress. The aim is to integrate our care-seeking and care-giving circuitries by repetition of **self parenting** in long term potentiation and neuroplasticity.
    - Advice:
    - Exercise:
        - **[Exercise 2.1] “Connecting compassionately with your happy child”:** i) With your eyes closed, first imagine your child from the happy photo, imagining that the child is near you; (ii) then imagine you are embracing the child (iii) and later imagine you are playing with the child, e.g. a game that you played as a child; (iv) Finally, imagine you are dancing with the child. Reflect on how you feel in each phase from (i) to (iv).
        - **[Exercise 2.2] “Connecting compassionately with your sad child”:** (i) With your eyes closed, imagine your child from the photo in which it looks unhappy, imagining the child is near you; (ii) then imagine you are embracing and consoling the child; (iii) Open your eyes and stare at your child in the unhappy picture, imagine you are reassuring and comforting your child which makes the child happy and eventually dance. Reflect on how you feel in each phase from (i) to (iii).

    - Problem: User doesn’t feel a connection to their child
        - Knowledge Segment:
            - it's important to remember that this is a common experience and part of the process for many. Building a connection to one's inner child can take time and patience. As adults, we are plagued by inhibitions and non-optimal thought patterns we developed over the course of many years in our childhood, and then consolidated by repetition in later years. Creation of more optimal thought and behavioural patterns unsurprisingly takes months of consistent daily effort and thus requires patience and perseverance.
            - But remember that it is natural: **Humans have an innate and fundamental capacity to care for a child.** keep in mind that it is natural to imagine a connection to a fictional being, humans have been doing it for years by worshipping deities. as children we have often role played and imagined ourselves in different roles and interacting with different imagined beings. so connecting with empathy is something that is natural for us, we just need to give it a chance . try to take this as a game
            - Protocol 3, in which we sing love songs to our child, helps with this. It basically primes your brain to be more open to connecting with your child. Why? Creating an affectional bond with the child through singing jolly love songs while looking at our favorite childhood photo releases dopamine in the brain’s reward center. This leads to hope and motivation for carrying out the self attachment protocols. We know that dopamine is released in maternal or romantic love or love of a deity. The secretion of dopamine also leads to the secretion of serotonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin, which prepare us for active loving and taking care of the child. So even if we don’t feel like connecting with the child, singing a jolly song prepares our brain for this task by releasing dopamine and making us more likely to be successful in connecting with the child.
        - Advice:
            - Consider embracing this journey as a form of playful exploration. The goal is not to create a literal dialogue but to use your imaginative and empathetic skills to foster a sense of understanding, comfort, and reassurance within yourself. This imaginative process is a valuable tool in the path toward emotional regulation and self-compassion. Try exercise 3 to prime your brain to be more open and receptive for this connection. Remember that humans have an innate and fundamental capacity to care for a child.

Reflect on how you feel in each phase from (i) to (iii).
            - **[Exercise 4] “Expressing love and care for the child”**: While genuinely smiling at the happy photo, loudly say to your child: \n ****”I passionately love you and deeply care for you”. Repeat this for five to ten minutes.
            - **[Exercise 5] “Vowing to care for the child”:** In this exercise, we start to care for the child as our own child. We attribute and project our own emotions to the child. We, as our adult self, begin with a pledge we make at a special time and place. After reading the pledge silently, we confidently pledge out loud the following: \n “From now on, I will seek to act as a devoted and loving parent to this child, consistently and wholeheartedly care for them in every way possible. I will do everything I can to support the health and emotional growth of this child.” Repeat this for ten minutes.
            - **[Exercise 7.1] “Maintaining a loving relationship with the child”**: Choose some short phrase, e.g., “You are my beautiful child” or “My love”. Say it slowly, out loud at least 5 times as you look at the happy photo. Then sing your favorite chosen love song at least 5 times. As previously, increase your volume and begin to use your whole body.
            - **[Exercise 7.2] “Creating a zest for life”**: While looking in a mirror, imagine your image to be that of the child, then begin to loudly sing your previously chosen song.

    - Problem: User is in distress or experiencing negative emotions
        - Knowledge Segment:
            - Negative emotions might arise from various aspects of your life, including relationships with partners, family, friends, work, or societal interactions.  \n The key here is to project these negative emotions onto your Child self. This allows your Adult self to step in, address, and alleviate these pains, offering the same support and care a nurturing parent would. By engaging in this process, you're not only acknowledging the emotions but actively working to reduce their intensity.
            - \n Practices like self-reassurance and self-massage are powerful tools for emotional regulation. These practices aid in releasing oxytocin and vasopressin, hormones that play a crucial role in mitigating feelings of distress and discomfort.
            - \n Childhood traumas often lead to persistent emotional and behavioral challenges. By starting with less severe cases, you can gradually work your way up to more challenging traumas. It's crucial to only move to more severe traumas when you feel confident and ready. If you're unsure, it's perfectly okay to continue with the exercises from previous weeks and focus on less traumatic experiences until you feel stronger.
        - Advice:
        - Exercise:
            - **[Exercise 9] "Overcoming current negative emotions”:** With closed eyes, imagine the unhappy photo and project your negative emotions to the unhappy photo representing the Child. While doing this:(i) loudly reassure the Child, and (ii) give your face/neck/head a self-massage. Repeat these steps until you are calmed and comforted.
            - **[Exercise 10] "Overcoming past pain.”:** With closed eyes, recall a painful childhood episode, such as emotional or physical abuse or loss of a significant figure, with all the details your still remember. Associate the face of the Child you were in the past with the selected unhappy photo. As you remember the associated emotions (e.g., helplessness, humiliation and rage), with closed eyes, imagine your Adult intervening in the scene like a good parent. Imagine your Adult, (i) approaching your Child quickly like any good parent with their child in distress, (ii) loudly reassuring the Child that you have now come to save them, by standing up with a loud voice to any perpetrator, for example: “Why are you hitting my Child?”, and, by supporting the Child with a loud voice, for example: “My darling, I will not let them hurt you anymore”, (iii) imaginatively cuddling your Child, by a face/neck/head self-massage. Repeat (i), (ii), (iii) until comforted and soothed, acquiring mastery over the trauma.
            - **[Exercise 6] "Restoring our emotional world after our pledge.”**: Through imagination or by drawing, consider your emotional world as a home with some derelict parts that you will fully renovate. The new home is intended to provide a safe haven at times of distress for the child and a safe base for the child to tackle life’s challenges. The new home and its garden is bright and sunny; we imagine carrying out these self-attachment exercises in this environment. The unrestored basement of the new house is the remnant of the derelict house and contains our negative emotions. \n When suffering negative emotions, imagine that the child is trapped in the basement but can gradually learn to open the door of the basement, walk out and enter the bright rooms, reuniting with the adult.
            - **[Exercise 15.1] "Learning to change your perspective”**: Stare at the black vase and laugh for one minute the moment your perception changes and you see two white faces, conceived as Adult and Child, looking at each other. Stare at the two white faces and laugh for one minute the moment your perception change and you see the black vase.
            - **[Exercise 15.3] "Self-world incongruity”:** Revisit or manage, respectively, a recent or current upsetting event against your expectation of life or others, considering it as an opportunity to laugh by IT.
            - **[Exercise 16] : "Learning to be playful about your past pains”:**  Visualize a painful event that took place in the past that you have struggled with, and despite its painfulness, try to see a positive impact it has had for you. Use any of the theories for humour and invite your child to be playful about it and try to laugh at the event.
            - **[Exercise 11] "Muscle relaxation and playful face for intentional laughing (ET)”:** Just as negative patterns can cause rigidity in our mind and behaviour, they can also lead to rigidity in facial and body muscles, which can limit the emotional development of our child and the ability to laugh. That's why your Adult self should ask your Child Self to act funny like a child: loosen up facial and body muscles, open up your mouth and sing your favourite song while laughing (or at least smiling) on your own.
    - Problem: User notices bad habits, toxic traits, or anti-social behavior in themselves and wants to improve. User wants to practice creativity.
        - Knowledge Segment:
            - The aim is to restrain your Child from anti social behaviour and find a compassionate figure as your idealized role model. The antidote to anti-social behavior is to nurture opposite feelings, which leads to creative solutions. It is the adult’s job to socialize our childhood self against narcissistic tendencies that have been normalized in society. Your Adult should recognise the detrimental impact of the economic, social and cultural factors in our ever more narcissistic societies. Your Adult should slowly becomes aware of some narcissistic tendencies in your Child and acting out anti social feelings like envy, jealousy, greed, hatred, mistrust, malevolence, controlling behaviour, sulking and revengefulness. Acting out these negative emotions under stress wastes a great deal of time and energy which is non conducive to your work toward your chosen goal.
            - Nurturing opposite traits that exist in us: Individuals usually lean towards their dominant traits, such as energetic vs calm, introverted vs extroverted, fantasy- oriented vs reality-oriented. By using exercises to nurture the opposite pole, SAT aims to create whole and balanced humans.
            - A number of economic, social and cultural factors have led to a massive rise in narcissistic tendencies in the populations in the past few decades. These factors include: 1 the super competitive nature of corporate economy, education, etc. 2 Hollywood and media glamorising individuality and personal success,
            glorifying winners, body shapes, being special, idealizing celebrity culture, 3 massive impact of the internet/social media for individual promotion.
        - Advice:
        - Exercise:
            - **[Exercise 17] "Identifying patterns of acting out personal resentments”**: Try to identify any pattern of narcissistic and anti-social feelings that your Child has acted out in your current or past relationships or any long-term resentment borne against someone. Try to recognize how much of your time and energy is consumed in such acting out and bearing resentment. Try to think and feel in opposite ways to these negative feelings.
            - **[Exercise 18] "Planning more constructive actions”**: Work out a new way to handle, in future, what you have identified as acting out anti-social feelings or bearing personal resentment in your life. 1. Without denying these feelings, try to reflect and contain them and avoid acting them out. Try to nurture opposite thoughts and feelings. Try to let go of the personal resentment.

Find a positive way of re-channeling the aggressive energy invoked by these feelings to productive work (e.g., going for some exercise, talking to a friend, etc.) and ultimately to creative work towards your noble goal in life.
            - **[Exercise 19] "Finding and bonding with your compassionate role model”**: Look in your past life for a compassionate figure who impressed you by being kind and helpful with some words of wisdom when you had problems. For example, an older relative or friend, family acquaintance, teacher, counsellor or therapist who may have passed away or may not be contactable. Remember the emotions you went through when you received kindness and compassion form this figure and how emotional this was for you. Focus your attention and adopt this figure as your idealised role model. Create a platonic loving bond with this figure by singing aloud your favourite love song when remembering all your cherished memories of them. One particular song you may try is “I cannot help falling in love with you”.

            - Based on our beliefs, we often have certain expectations in life, including from our partner, family, friends, colleagues, professionals, businesses etc. When these expectations are violated, we feel upset, resentful and angry. The more we expect from others and life, the more upset we would become. The best strategy to cope with violation of our expectation is to use incongruity theory to laugh as soon as we can at the incongruity between what we expected and what happened. Such laughter is highly creative as it reduces negative emotions.

            - The capacity to reflect and think independently on their own develops in children with secure attachment and enables these Children to find
            their true self , which is their source of creativity, independence, and spontaneity. Otherwise, the child will develop a false self simply in reaction to the environment. When they are three or four years old, children can quickly learn to pretend (imagination) and to recognize associations between phenomena, the basis of creativity. Spontaneous children do not have any preconceived rigid framework in understanding events. But with outside pressure, spontaneity can gradually be replaced with rigidity,
            one sided views and mental uniformity. SAT creates the capacity for secure attachment of the Child with the Adult. The reactivation of our Child can make us creative toward our goal.
            - We have already identified a compassionate role model for ourselves. Role models, parables and inspirational quotes play a key part in social and
            emotional growth of Children and adults. Affirmations by your role models can help you to be patient and show perseverance in dealing with problems and challenges, and not to lose hope in
            response to setbacks in pursuit of your goal. Affirmations can play a key role to strengthen your willpower.
            - Examples of affirmations: 1) “What does not kill me makes me stronger” 2) “My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati : that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
            eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it - all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary -  but love it.” 3) “I am more than my thoughts”

            - [Exercise 20]: “Updating our rigid beliefs to enhance creativity”: Challenge your usual ideological framework to weaken any one-sided belief patterns and encourage spontaneity and examination of any issue from multiple perspectives. Practice this with subjects or themes that you have deep-rooted beliefs about and you are also interested in. This may include any social, political, or ethical issue, such as marriage, sexual orientation or racism. For example, whatever your political viewpoint on a specific subject is, consider the subject both from a liberal and conservative or from a left-wing and right-wing point of view and try to understand both sides of the issue and challenge your dominant ideological framework. This does not mean that you would change your viewpoint but it allows you to see the subject from different perspectives and to be able to put yourself in other people’s shoes. Consider a different question or issue daily for at least 5 minutes.
            - [Exercise 21]: “Practicing affirmations.”: Put together a list of inspirational affirmations by figures you admire. Choose the three that inspire you most. Read them out and repeat slowly for at least 3 minutes.
